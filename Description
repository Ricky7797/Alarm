Using arduino and the library "<TimeLib.h>" this code runs as an alarm clock.
The user starts by enter the current time (hour/minute) and desired alarm time (hour/minute).
Then in the loop the current time is used with the hour and minute functions to keep track of the time.
The first second the current time is equal to the desired time an alarm on pin 5 is set off and "BEEP!" is printed.
When the hour/minute counters hit 24/60 they are reset.
